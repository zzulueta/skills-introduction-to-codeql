## Review

Great job completing the exercise! You have now:

- Enabled Code Scanning with CodeQL in your repository.
- Introduced and detected a vulnerability using a pull request.
- Reviewed and triaged CodeQL alerts.
- Fixed a security vulnerability and verified the alert was resolved.

By following these steps, you’ve learned how to use GitHub’s security features to keep your codebase safe. Remember, regularly reviewing and addressing security alerts is an important part of maintaining healthy projects.
